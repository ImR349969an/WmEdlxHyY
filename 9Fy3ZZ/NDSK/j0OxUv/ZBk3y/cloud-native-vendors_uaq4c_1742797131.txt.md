# Order Management System 🚀🛒

## Project Overview 📝

This Order Management System is a microservices-based application ⚙️ designed to streamline e-commerce operations. It focuses on efficiently managing products 📦, inventory Stock📈, orders 🛍️, and payments 💳. The system is built with user authentication 🔑, supporting both vendor 🧑‍💼 and customer 🧑‍🧑‍🤝‍🧑 roles. It leverages asynchronous task processing ⏱️ for improved performance and scalability ☁️. Designed to be cloud-native 🌐, it utilizes Docker 🐳 for containerization and Consul 🧭 for service discovery.

## Services 🧩

The system is composed of distinct microservices, each handling a specific domain:

*   **Gateway Service 🚪**:
    *   Serves as the single entry point for all external API requests 🚦.

    *   Manages the entire product catalog and detailed product information ℹ️.
    *   Empowers vendors to create ➕, update ✏️, delete 🗑️, and list products 📜.
    *   Stores all product-related information in MongoDB 💾.
    *   Dispatches product-related events via RabbitMQ (e.g., product creation, updates, deletions 📢).

*   **Inventory Service Stock📈**:
    *   Precisely manages product inventory levels 📊.
    *   Enables vendors to efficiently create ➕, update ✏️, delete 🗑️, and retrieve inventory details for their products 📦.

*   **Order Service 🛍️**:
    *   Oversees the complete order lifecycle: creation ➕, retrieval 🔍, and cancellation ❌.
    *   Calculates order totals accurately and manages order statuses effectively 🔄.
    *   Stores comprehensive order information in MongoDB 💾.
    *   Broadcasts order-related events using RabbitMQ (e.g., order creation, cancellation, successful payments 📢).

*   **Payment Service 💳**:
    *   Facilitates secure payment processing using Stripe 💰.
    *   Generates unique payment links for each order 🔗.
    *   Processes real-time webhook events from Stripe for immediate payment confirmations and notifications of failures 📞.
    *   Interacts with Auth, Product, and Order services via high-performance gRPC 🗣️.
    *   Subscribes to relevant order and product events from RabbitMQ to orchestrate payment workflows and maintain data synchronization with Stripe 🔄.
    *   Sends timely email notifications for order confirmations and cancellations through the Mailer service ✉️.

*   **Mailer Service ✉️**:
    *   Dedicated to sending emails for crucial events: user registration, account activation, password resets, and order confirmations 📧.
    *   Utilizes Mailpit for efficient local email testing and SMTP for reliable real email delivery 🧪➡️📤.
    *   Subscribes to user-related events from RabbitMQ to trigger automated email sending processes 📬.

## Functionalities ✨
